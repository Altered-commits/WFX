To implement:
1. Auto user code compiling into dll (Done)
2. Middleware (Done) 
3. Hot Reload
4. HTML Templating (SSR)
5. DB support

To Fix:
1. Latency issues (Need more Requests per second to be handled) (Done, Sort of fixed)
2. Crashing issue. Anything using 'ctx' inside of engine is bound to crash wfx, idk why
    - Proper context erasing and handling
3. Cache files < 4KB, don't use TransmitFile on every single file
4. Logic for handling 'Write' and 'WriteFile' calls + Proper flushing of write buffers in engine.cpp
