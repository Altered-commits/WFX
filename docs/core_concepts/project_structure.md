# Project Structure

This page explains the default folder and file layout generated by WFX when you create a new project using:

```bash
./wfx new <project_name>
```

Understanding this structure will help you know where files live, what each directory is responsible for, and how WFX serves content.

## Directory Overview

A freshly generated WFX project looks like this:

<pre class="code-format">
&lt;your_workspace&gt;/
├─ &lt;your_project_name&gt;/
│  ├─ build/
│  ├─ intermediate/
│  │
│  ├─ public/
│  │  ├─ style.css
│  │  └─ script.js
│  │
│  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ main.cpp
│  │  └─ api_entry.cpp
│  │
│  ├─ templates/
│  │  └─ index.html
│  │
│  ├─ .gitignore
│  ├─ CMakeLists.txt
│  └─ wfx.toml
│
├─ WFX/
│  └─ (engine source code)
│
└─ wfx
</pre>

Each directory and file has a specific purpose, explained below.

---

## `<your_project_name>/`

This directory contains **your application code and assets**.  
Everything inside this folder belongs to your WFX project.

---

### `build/`, `intermediate/`

Contains generated build artifacts which are created and managed automatically by WFX and the build system.

These directories are generated automatically and **must never be edited manually**.

While they can be safely deleted at any time, it is strongly recommended to delete **both directories together** rather than deleting one and leaving the other behind.

---

### `public/`

This folder contains all files that are publicly accessible. This includes CSS, JavaScript, images, and any other static assets. Files placed here are automatically served by WFX when a request hits the **/public/** route, and can be accessed directly via that route regardless of whether they are referenced by any template (`.html`).

!!! warning
    Do not place any sensitive or private files in this folder. All content here is publicly visible. This directory is strictly for static assets meant to be accessible by anyone, and the system assumes no responsibility for accidental exposure.

---

### `src/`

This directory contains all C++ source files that implement your application logic.

By default, **main.cpp** is provided with a few example routes to demonstrate basic functionality. You are free to modify or remove this file as needed. You may also add any number of additional C++ source files and subdirectories inside `src/`.

The WFX build system automatically discovers and compiles all `.cpp` files located under `src/`, including those inside nested folders. File and directory naming is entirely up to you, with one exception: **api_entry.cpp**.

**api_entry.cpp** is a special, engine-required file and **must NOT be modified or deleted**. It is used internally by WFX to wire application code into the engine.

---

### `templates/`

This directory is dedicated to storing all HTML files that the server can render and deliver to clients. It should exclusively contain `.html` files, whether they are static pages (fixed content) or dynamic templates (rendered with SSR).

No other file types - such as CSS, JavaScript, or images - should be placed here.

---

### `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file controls which files and directories are excluded from version control.  
It comes preconfigured to ignore generated directories such as `build/` and `intermediate/` by default.

You are free to modify `.gitignore` as needed to suit your workflow (for example, to ignore editor files, local configs, or additional generated artifacts).

---

### `CMakeLists.txt`
`CMakeLists.txt` defines how your project is configured and built using CMake.

!!! warning
    **Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing.**  
    Incorrect changes may break the build system or cause undefined behavior.  
    If you need custom build logic, it is recommended to understand the existing configuration first before making any changes.

---

### `wfx.toml`

The `wfx.toml` file is the main configuration file for the entire project. It defines settings for both your project and the WFX engine. This file is required for the project to function correctly and should be version-controlled.

---

## `WFX/`

The `WFX/` folder contains the source code of the WFX engine. It is required for building and running the project, as it represents the framework itself rather than your application code.

In most cases, you do not need to modify anything in this directory. It is meant to provide the core functionality of the framework and should be treated as a stable, internal component of the project.

---

## `wfx`

The `wfx` file is the compiled engine and command-line interface for WFX, built from the `WFX/` folder using CMake. It powers most of the framework's functionality, including project creation, running the server, and so on.

Common commands include:

```bash
 * build    -   Pre-build various parts of WFX
 * doctor   -   Verify system requirements (Deprecated)
 * run      -   Start WFX server
 * new      -   Create a new WFX project
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have an overview of the project structure, you can start exploring how to work with WFX:

- **Engine Commands**: Learn how `wfx` CLI works. See [Engine Commands](engine_commands.md) for details.  
- **Configuration**: Understand and modify `wfx.toml` to customize project settings. See [WFX Settings](wfx_toml.md) for details.
